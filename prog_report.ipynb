        "Our project focuses around how different music affects the mood of different listeners. The data set that we have chosen tracks the mood of listeners for various different songs. It also keeps track of other details and features of the songs, such as length, tempo, key, time signature, and popularity. Our group aims to find which of these key characteristics can best determine whether or not a listener will experience a positive or negative mood in response. With the data we can also see temporal trends, and perhaps see if there are any time periods that caused a change in trend for music mood and how they correlate to the events going on in the world.\n",

Based on looking at the data after cleaning it, it appears that key and tempo change across different musical pieces while time signuature appears to be commonly 4 beats per measure but this value is not consistently 4 beats per measure for all songs recorded. There also seem to be different moods present but the Happy and Sad moods seem to be the most useful as they are opposites and can provide greater insights into individual's personal feelings for a song.\n",

It appears that songs that invoke feelings of happiness are often caused to make people feel good about themselves and to emphasize such feelings of joy are generally played at faster tempos. This is indicated below with the average tempo of happy songs are more quicker compared to sad songs. In general, people tend to want to feel happy so happy or feel-good songs tend to be more popular across individuals compared to sad songs.

        "\n",
        "The interesting hypothesis considered here is thinking about how tempo is affected based on the moods that the particular songs invoke. Various moods (happy, sad, energetic, or calm) have different levels or speeds the musical piece is played to portray the overall song's atmosphere.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this is an interesting hypothesis to investigate?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This was an interesting hypothesis to investigate to consider one of the important factors that contribute to why people feel a certain way towards particular songs. The tempo of the song can alter how the song makes an individual feel and can be interesting to observe this dynamic visually. For that, it was fascinating to consider this idea and investigate affects of tempo on moods pertaining to different songs\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interesting Graph Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "The key things that appear evident at first glance is that there are outliers present for the happy and calm moods. This may mean that tempos have drastically differing values outside of the 5-number summary for songs invoking feelings of happiness and calmness. Other noticeable things is that happy and energetic songs have higher medians compared to the sad and calm songs. The range of tempos for sad, energetic, and calm songs are more than happy songs. This could be that happy songs fall within a subset of tempos to achieve happiness in the song. It also appears to be that songs that are sad or calm are more slower to create sorrowful or serene tones which are not played at quick speeds but lower tempos. This can be observed with the lower quartile of sad and calm songs being 50 to 100 beats per minute. In contrast, energetic and happy songs have a higher quartile range between 75 to 125 beats per minute."

However, we can see that the svm still has a high margin of error, showing that it is not the most ideal model. We could consider using multiple pieces of data in our model rather than only popularity, which would give the model more to work with and potentially lead to greater accuracy."

        "The hardest part of the project was to try to find a useful dataset or data source that can help us find meaningful insights on what causes people to feel certain ways when listening to different musical genres while considering how this can affect their mental health/well-being. At first, we have created google surveys to collect data on a person's age group, how a set of musical genres makes them feel one of three ways (positive, neutral, or negative), and if those musical genre selection affect their mental health/well-being. This data was limited in scope as these factors are not enough to draw meaningful conclusions from so we decided to use another dataset pertaining to music. This data was more useful as there were other useful factors since as time, key, time signature, tempo, popularity, and moods which was what we wanted to address as a group. Other difficult aspects of the project was finding useful insights on the data to help make informed conclusions on addressing our initial poroblem. This meant observing and cleaning the data to better help us make meaningful visualizations and develop useful ML models. Finding those factors and fidning relationships that were relevant such as popularity, time signature, and tempo of a song to the moods was not simple.\n",

        "From the data, the initial insights are that various moods (happy, sad, energetic, and calm) are influenced based on some key features of songs. These include the song's tempo, key, time signature, and popularity. From the exploratory data analysis and visualizations, it can observed that songs that invoke feelings of happiness and are energetic are played at faster tempos and are only played with a 3 or 4 time signatures (beats per measure). In contrast, sad and calm songs are played at 1, 3, 4, 5 time signature with more time signature variability but played at slower tempos. However, though the EDA may show that average popularity was more for happier songs than sad songs the time signature says otherwise. The first visualization shows that sad songs with 5 beats per measure have large following as the popularity is much greater than all other mood and time signature combinations presented in this graph.\n",

        "So far based on the dataset we have cleaned up we were able to identify some patterns and correlations between the moods and musical features like the tempo of the songs. Some concrete results we discussed are finding the descriptive statistics and visualizations so far. This led us to make some hypotheses, for instance, we saw there was an average tempo across all songs like happy ones, and sad ones. For example, sad songs had a higher average tempo of 115.59 beats per minute. We concluded that faster tempos meant that people could happier potentially be because these songs evoke feelings of happiness. We also designed some visualizations such as the barplot and boxplots that had some interesting patterns but also outliers. The barplot displayed different moods based on popularity and time signature. On the other hand, the boxplot determined how moods varied across different tempos. As a result, we were able to make some hypotheses that this can be from the tempo a factor we can look more into that can determine why a person can feel a certain way towards certain songs.\n",

        "In the beginning, we collected our initial data through Google Forms and got a good number of responses but we noticed that data was limited so that is why we chose to explore other public datasets that were available. This was a problem before but we have found a solution for it. With the new data set, we were able to design some visualizations to get a better understanding of the data we have. Currently, we have yet to make any big test to support our hypothesis, we did discuss the potential use of a 5-KNN model but we can explore other approaches to see if we can get useful answers. Another thing is that we should look deeper into our data if any limitations might affect our results so we can perform more tests just to make sure our data is diverse and have a wide range of features we can use whether it is the genres or other demographics. Not sure if the complexity of mood is too complex enough or if we should consider incorporating external factors that can either involve choosing songs with specific moods or how it influences so it is something to keep in mind. \n",

With creation of data vizualizations, we were better able to see and understand patterns in the data, and with use of machine learning models we were better able to understand relationships between various features of the data and their impact on the mood of a song. Through our explorations, we could see the relations between various factors and how they affect the mood that a song evokes in its audience. Due to these explorations we have made and the conclusions we were able to draw, I believe we are on track with our project. Moving forward, we will probably dedicate our time to more analysis so we can get an even better understanding of the influences on a song's mood.\n",

We could mix the sample data we collect with the current data to get a wider and an unbiased audience. Another change that we could make is improve the testing accuracy of the machine learning models. One approach for this would be is to shuffle the data beforehand and split the data into training and testing data using a 80/20 split with 80% for training and 20% for testing. All these changes would improve our current results because it would remove biases. Additionally, randomizing the data before training and testing would improve accuracies and results."

We will also try to find more datasets as well to improve the bias that might exist in the one dataset that we are using right now. We plan to evaluate whether we have achieved these goals by validating our ML model accuracies and seeing the interpretations of our visualizations. If our ML model accuracies have improved from the ones here and possibly crossed some level of accuracy threshold, it could be a way to measure the predictive accuracy of the ML model for future datasets pertaining to musical features determining various moods. The visualizations created and interpretations made from them could consider other features affecting mood which can help make more diverse and meaningful insights on the data to what we are trying to solve."
