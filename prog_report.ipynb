        "Our project focuses around how different music affects the mood of different listeners. The data set that we have chosen tracks the mood of listeners for various different songs. It also keeps track of other details and features of the songs, such as length, tempo, key, time signature, and popularity. Our group aims to find which of these key characteristics can best determine whether or not a listener will experience a positive or negative mood in response. With the data we can also see temporal trends, and perhaps see if there are any time periods that caused a change in trend for music mood and how they correlate to the events going on in the world.\n",

Based on looking at the data after cleaning it, it appears that key and tempo change across different musical pieces while time signature appears to be commonly 4 beats per measure but this value is not consistently 4 beats per measure for all songs recorded. There also seem to be different moods present but the Happy and Sad moods seem to be the most useful as they are opposites and can provide greater insights into individual's personal feelings for a song.\n",

It appears that songs that invoke feelings of happiness are often caused to make people feel good about themselves and to emphasize such feelings of joy are generally played at faster tempos. This is indicated below with the average tempo of happy songs are more quicker compared to sad songs. In general, people tend to want to feel happy so happy or feel-good songs tend to be more popular across individuals compared to sad songs.

We can see that for calm or happy music, the time signature does not make too much of an impact on how popular those songs end up being.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can see that for energetic music, there are no songs with the time signature of 1 or 5. This can lead us to conclude that a consistent and relatively faster time signature is key to music being categorized as \"energetic\". The same can be said for happy music. We can explore the data further and see if happy and energetic music falls under some sort of \"formula\" - we can see if other factors of the song such as tempo follow similar guidelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sad and calm music have more variability in their time signature, and it is clear from the visualization that sad music has the most. Sad songs trend more towards the edges of the time signature domain, most songs either having a time signature of 1 or 5."

        "\n",
        "The interesting hypothesis considered here is thinking about how tempo is affected based on the moods that the particular songs invoke. Various moods (happy, sad, energetic, or calm) have different levels or speeds the musical piece is played to portray the overall song's atmosphere.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this is an interesting hypothesis to investigate?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This was an interesting hypothesis to investigate to consider one of the important factors that contribute to why people feel a certain way towards particular songs. The tempo of the song can alter how the song makes an individual feel and can be interesting to observe this dynamic visually. For that, it was fascinating to consider this idea and investigate affects of tempo on moods pertaining to different songs\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interesting Graph Insights**\n",
        "\n",
        "The key things that appear evident at first glance is that there are outliers present for the happy and calm moods. This may mean that tempos have drastically differing values outside of the 5-number summary for songs invoking feelings of happiness and calmness. Other noticeable things are that happy and energetic songs have higher medians compared to the sad and calm songs. The range of tempos for sad, energetic, and calm songs are more than happy songs. This could be that happy songs fall within a subset of tempos to achieve happiness in the song. It also appears to be that songs that are sad or calm are more slower to create sorrowful or serene tones which are not played at quick speeds but lower tempos. This can be observed with the lower quartile of sad and calm songs being 50 to 100 beats per minute. In contrast, energetic and happy songs have a higher quartile range between 75 to 125 beats per minute."

        "The hardest part of the project was to try to find a useful dataset or data source that can help us find meaningful insights on what causes people to feel certain ways when listening to different musical genres while considering how this can affect their mental health/well-being. At first, we have created google surveys to collect data on a person's age group, how a set of musical genres makes them feel one of three ways (positive, neutral, or negative), and if those musical genre selections affect their mental health/well-being. This data was limited in scope as these factors are not enough to draw meaningful conclusions from so we decided to use another dataset pertaining to music. This data was more useful as there were other useful factors since as time, key, time signature, tempo, popularity, and moods which was what we wanted to address as a group. Other difficult aspects of the project was finding useful insights on the data to help make informed conclusions on addressing our initial problem. This meant observing and cleaning the data to better help us make meaningful visualizations and develop useful ML models. Finding those factors and fidning relationships that were relevant such as popularity, time signature, and tempo of a song to the moods was not simple.\n",

        "From the data, the initial insights are that various moods (happy, sad, energetic, and calm) are influenced based on some key features of songs. These include the song's tempo, key, time signature, and popularity. From the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, it can observed that songs that invoke feelings of happiness and are energetic are played at faster tempos and are only played with a 3 or 4 time signatures (beats per measure). In contrast, sad and calm songs are played at 1, 3, 4, 5 time signature with more time signature variability but played at slower tempos. However, though the EDA may show that average popularity was more for happier songs than sad songs the time signature says otherwise. The first visualization shows that sad songs with 5 beats per measure have large following as the popularity is much greater than all other mood and time signature combinations presented in this graph.\n",
